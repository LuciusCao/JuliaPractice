# JuliaPractice
This repository is used to practice and share my learning on JuliaLang so far.
It has been two weeks since I learned Julia Lang. I was deeply attracted by her high performance and parallel computation. the concept that julia was designed on is very different from Python (or more properly, from numpy) and other major programing language for her devectorization. It takes me some time, actually quite a while to switch from vectorized computation to devectorized computation.
